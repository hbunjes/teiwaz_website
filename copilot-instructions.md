## Astro Best Practices
This guide outlines **best practices** for building an **Astro** application. The goal is **readability and maintainability**, minimizing abstraction to keep the codebase clear.

## Tech Stack Overview
- Astro
- Tailwind CSS
- Postgres


## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
Keep a **flat and predictable** folder structure:

```
src/
  /components/  # Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
  /pages/       # Page components (mapped to routes)
  /stores/      # Nanostores for state management
  /hooks/       # Custom React hooks (if needed)
  /utils/       # Simple utility functions (date formatting, API requests, etc.)
  /assets/      # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
  /styles/      # Tailwind config and global CSS files (if any)
  main.tsx      # Entry point
  app.tsx       # Root component
  routes.tsx    # Centralized route definitions
```

üìå **Rules**:
- **Flat is better than nested.**
- **No generic 'helpers' folder.**
- **Keep components close to where they are used.**


## Component Creation Guidelines

### When to Create a New Component
- Create a new component when:
  - UI element will be reused in multiple places
  - A section of UI exceeds 100 lines of code
  - A section has its own distinct responsibility or purpose
  - Logic for a section becomes complex (more than 3 state variables or hooks)
  - Component has a specific interaction pattern (dropdown, modal, etc.)

### When NOT to Create a New Component
- Avoid creating components that are:
  - Used only once and very simple (under 50 lines)
  - Too granular (e.g., a single styled button with no special behavior)
  - Breaking a component only for the sake of smaller files

### Component Types
- **Astro Components** (`.astro`): Use for:
  - Layout components
  - Static content
  - Components that don't need client-side interactivity
  
- **React Components** (`.jsx`/`.tsx`): Use for:
  - Interactive UI elements
  - Components that need to maintain state
  - Sections requiring event handlers and user interactions


## Markup and Tailwind CSS Guidelines

### Keep Markup Simple
- Aim for a maximum nesting depth of 3-4 levels
- Avoid excessive conditional rendering that creates multiple levels of nesting
- Use sensible defaults for CSS with minimal override complexity
- Leverage Astro's slot system for flexible component composition

### Tailwind Best Practices
- Use Tailwind's utility classes directly in HTML/JSX for most styling
- Extract reusable patterns to components rather than creating custom classes
- For complex components, consider grouping Tailwind classes with template literals
- Utilize Tailwind's `@apply` directive sparingly and only for highly reused patterns
- Create consistent spacing, color and typography systems through Tailwind configuration

### Component Composition Example
```jsx
// Bad: Overly nested and complex
<div className="p-4 border rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
    <div className="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{title}</h3>
        {isEditable && (
          <div className="flex space-x-2">
            <button className="px-2 py-1 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">Edit</button>
            <button className="px-2 py-1 bg-red-500 text-white rounded">Delete</button>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

// Good: Flatter, component-based approach
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{title}</h3>
    {isEditable && <ActionButtons actions={['edit', 'delete']} />}
  </CardHeader>
</Card>
```

## Astro and React Integration

### Astro Components Best Practices
- Use Astro for static or mostly-static pages and layouts
- Pass data to React components as props
- Take advantage of Astro's built-in data fetching for SEO-critical content
- Add client directives only where needed:
  - `client:load` - Hydrate component immediately on page load
  - `client:idle` - Hydrate once the browser is idle
  - `client:visible` - Hydrate once the component is visible in viewport
  - `client:only` - Only renders on client-side, never SSR

### React with Nanostores in Astro
- Use `@nanostores/react` for React components to access stores
- Import `useStore` hook to subscribe components to store changes
- Keep React components focused on UI rendering
- Move business logic and data fetching to store actions

```jsx
// React component with nanostores
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { todoStore, addTodo, toggleTodo } from '../stores/todoStore';

function TodoList() {
  const todos = useStore(todoStore);
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (newTodo.trim()) {
      addTodo(newTodo);
      setNewTodo('');
    }
  };
  
  return (
    // Component JSX
  );
}
```

## Code Elegance Guidelines

### Simplicity Principles
- Functions should generally be under 20 lines
- Components should generally be under 150 lines
- Aim for component props to be under 7 items
- Use destructuring for cleaner component interfaces
- Group related state items in meaningful objects
- Follow the principle of least knowledge (components only know what they need)

### Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for heavier React components with `client:only` when needed
- Use Island Architecture to minimize JavaScript sent to the client
- Leverage Astro's static generation for content that doesn't change frequently
- Build component-specific stores to avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Code Organization
- Default export for the main component in a file
- Named exports for utility functions
- Group related hooks at the top of a component
- Keep event handlers inside the component, but separate from the JSX
